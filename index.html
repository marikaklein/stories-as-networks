<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">...and I hung up the phone.</span>
<span class="test">Immediately I recollected the voice that had spoken in German.</span>
<span class="test">It was that of Captain Richard Madden. Madden, in Viktor Runeberg's office, meant the end of all our work and - though this seemed a secondary matter, or should have seemed so to me - of our lives also.</span>
<span class="test">His being there meant that Runeberg had been arrested or murdered.</span>
<span class="test">Before the sun set on this same day, I ran the same risk.</span>
<span class="test">Madden was implacable.</span>
<span class="test">Rather, to be more accurate, he was obliged to be implacable.</span>
<span class="test">An Irishman in the service of England, a man suspected of equivocal feelings if not of actual treachery, how could he fail to welcome and seize upon this extraordinary piece of luck: the discovery, capture and perhaps the deaths of two agents of Imperial Germany?</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">I went up to my bedroom.</span>
<span class="test">Absurd though the gesture was, I closed and locked the door.</span>
<span class="test">I threw myself down on my narrow iron bed, and waited on my back.</span>
<span class="test">The never changing rooftops filled the window, and the hazy six o'clock sun hung in the sky.</span>
<span class="test">It seemed incredible that this day, a day without warnings or omens, might be that of my implacable death.</span>
<span class="test">In despite of my dead father, in despite of having been a child in one of the symmetrical gardens of Hai Feng, was I to die now?</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">Then I reflected that all things happen, happen to one, precisely now. </span>
<span class="test">Century follows century, and things happen only in the present.</span>
<span class="test">There are countless men in the air, on land and at sea, and all that really happens happens to me ...</span>
<span class="test">The almost unbearable memory of Madden's long horseface put an end to these wandering thoughts.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">In the midst of my hatred and terror (now that it no longer matters to me to speak of terror, now that I have outwitted Richard Madden, now that my neck hankers for the hangman's noose), I knew that the fast-moving and doubtless happy soldier did not suspect that I possessed the Secret - the name of the exact site of the new British artillery park on the Ancre.</span>
<span class="test">A bird streaked across the misty sky and, absently, I turned it into an airplane and then that airplane into many in the skies of France, shattering the artillery park under a rain of bombs.</span>
<span class="test">If only my mouth, before it should be silenced by a bullet, could shout this name in such a way that it could be heard in Germany ...</span>
<span class="test">My voice, my human voice, was weak.</span>
<span class="test">How could it reach the ear of the Chief?</span>
<span class="test">The ear of that sick and hateful man who knew nothing of Runeberg or of me except that we were in Staffordshire.</span>
<span class="test">A man who, sitting in his arid Berlin office, leafed infinitely through newspapers, looking in vain for news from us.</span>
<span class="test">I said aloud, "I must flee."</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">I sat up on the bed, in senseless and perfect silence, as if Madden was already peering at me.</span>
<span class="test">Something - perhaps merely a desire to prove my total penury to myself - made me empty out my pockets.</span>
<span class="test">I found just what I knew I was going to find.</span>
<span class="test">The American watch, the nickel-plated chain and the square coin, the key ring with the useless but compromising keys to Runeberg's office, the notebook, a letter which I decided to destroy at once (and which I did not destroy), a five shilling piece, two single shillings and some pennies, a red and blue pencil, a handkerchief - and a revolver with a single bullet.</span>
<span class="test">Absurdly I held it and weighed it in my hand, to give myself courage.</span>
<span class="test">Vaguely I thought that a pistol shot can be heard for a great distance.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">In ten minutes I had developed my plan.</span>
<span class="test">The telephone directory gave me the name of the one person capable of passing on the information.</span>
<span class="test">He lived in a suburb of Fenton, less than half an hour away by train.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">I am a timorous man.</span>
<span class="test">I can say it now, now that I have brought my incredibly risky plan to an end.</span>
<span class="test">It was not easy to bring about, and I know that its execution was terrible.</span>
<span class="test">I did not do it for Germany - no!</span>
<span class="test">Such a barbarous country is of no importance to me, particularly since it had degraded me by making me become a spy.</span>
<span class="test">Furthermore, I knew an Englishman - a modest man - who, for me, is as great as Goethe.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">I did not speak with him for more than an hour, but during that time, he was Goethe.</span>
<span class="test">I carried out my plan because I felt the Chief had some fear of those of my race, of those uncountable forebears whose culmination lies in me.</span>
<span class="test">I wished to prove to him that a yellow man could save his armies.</span>
<span class="test">Besides, I had to escape the Captain.</span>
<span class="test">His hands and voice could, at any moment, knock and beckon at my door.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">Silently, I dressed, took leave of myself in the mirror, went down the stairs, sneaked a look at the quiet street, and went out.</span>
<span class="test">The station was not far from my house, but I thought it more prudent to take a cab.</span>
<span class="test">I told myself that I thus ran less chance of being recognized.</span>
<span class="test">The truth is that, in the deserted street, I felt infinitely visible and vulnerable.</span>
<span class="test">I recall that I told the driver to stop short of the main entrance.</span>
<span class="test">I got out with a painful and deliberate slowness.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">I was going to the village of Ashgrove, but took a ticket for a station further on.</span>
<span class="test">The train would leave in a few minutes, at eight-fifty.</span>
<span class="test">I hurried, for the next would not go until half past nine.</span>
<span class="test">There was almost no one on the platform.</span>
<span class="test">I walked through the carriages.</span>
<span class="test">I remember some farmers, a woman dressed in mourning, a youth deep in Tacitus' Annals and a wounded, happy soldier.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">At last the train pulled out.</span>
<span class="test">A man I recognized ran furiously, but vainly, the length of the platform.</span>
<span class="test">It was Captain Richard Madden.</span>
<span class="test">Shattered, trembling, I huddled in the distant corner of the seat, as far as possible from the fearful window.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">From utter terror I passed into a state of almost abject happiness.</span>
<span class="test">I told myself that the duel had already started and that I had won the first encounter by besting my adversary in his first attack - even if it was only for forty minutes - by an accident of fate.</span>
<span class="test">I argued that so small a victory prefigured a total victory.</span>
<span class="test">I argued that it was not so trivial, that were it not for the precious accident of the train schedule, I would be in prison or dead.</span>
<span class="test">I argued, with no less sophism, that my timorous happiness was proof that I was man enough to bring this adventure to a successful conclusion.</span>
<span class="test">From my weakness I drew strength that never left me.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">I foresee that man will resign himself each day to new abominations, that soon only soldiers and bandits will be left.</span>
<span class="test">To them I offer this advice: Whosoever would undertake some atrocious enterprise should act as if it were already accomplished, should impose upon himself a future as irrevocable as the past.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">Thus I proceeded, while with the eyes of a man already dead, I contemplated the fluctuations of the day which would probably be my last, and watched the diffuse coming of night.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">The train crept along gently, amid ash trees.</span>
<span class="test">It slowed down and stopped, almost in the middle of a field.</span>
<span class="test">No one called the name of a station.</span>
<span class="test">"Ashgrove?" I asked some children on the platform.</span>
<span class="test">"Ashgrove," they replied.</span>
<span class="test">I got out.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">A lamp lit the platform, but the children's faces remained in a shadow.</span>
<span class="test">One of them asked me: "Are you going to Dr. Stephen Albert's house?"</span>
<span class="test">Without waiting for my answer, another said: "The house is a good distance away but you won't get lost if you take the road to the left and bear to the left at every crossroad."</span>
<span class="test">I threw them a coin (my last), went down some stone steps and started along a deserted road.</span>
<span class="test">At a slight incline, the road ran downhill.</span>
<span class="test">It was a plain dirt way, and overhead the branches of trees intermingled, while a round moon hung low in the sky as if to keep me company.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">For a moment I thought that Richard Madden might in some way have divined my desperate intent.</span>
<span class="test">At once I realized that this would be impossible.</span>
<span class="test">The advice about turning always to the left reminded me that such was the common formula for finding the central courtyard of certain labyrinths.</span>
<span class="test">I know something about labyrinths.</span>
<span class="test">Not for nothing am I the great grandson of Ts'ui Pen.</span>
<span class="test">He was Governor of Yunnan and gave up temporal power to write a novel with more characters than there are in the Hung Lou Meng, and to create a maze in which all men would lose themselves.</span>
<span class="test">He spent thirteen years on these oddly assorted tasks before he was assassinated by a stranger.</span>
<span class="test">His novel had no sense to it and nobody ever found his labyrinth.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">Under the trees of England I meditated on this lost and perhaps mythical labyrinth.</span>
<span class="test">I imagined it untouched and perfect on the secret summit of some mountain;</span> 
<span class="test">I imagined it drowned under rice paddies or beneath the sea;</span>
<span class="test">I imagined it infinite, made not only of eight-sided pavilions and of twisting paths but also of rivers, provinces and kingdoms ...</span>
<span class="test">I thought of a maze of mazes, of a sinuous, ever growing maze which would take in both past and future and would somehow involve the stars.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">Lost in these imaginary illusions I forgot my destiny - that of the hunted.</span>
<span class="test">For an undetermined period of time I felt myself cut off from the world, an abstract spectator.</span>
<span class="test">The hazy and murmuring countryside, the moon, the decline of the evening, stirred within me.</span>
<span class="test">Going down the gently sloping road I could not feel fatigue.</span>
<span class="test">The evening was at once intimate and infinite.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">The road kept descending and branching off, through meadows misty in the twilight.</span>
<span class="test">A high-pitched and almost syllabic music kept coming and going, moving with the breeze, blurred by the leaves and by distance.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">I thought that a man might be an enemy of other men, of the differing moments of other men, but never an enemy of a country: not of fireflies, words, gardens, streams, or the West wind.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">Meditating thus I arrived at a high, rusty iron gate.</span>
<span class="test">Through the railings I could see an avenue bordered with poplar trees and also a kind of summer house or pavilion.</span>
<span class="test">Two things dawned on me at once, the first trivial and the second almost incredible: the music came from the pavilion and that music was Chinese.</span>
<span class="test">That was why I had accepted it fully, without paying it any attention.</span>
<span class="test">I do not remember whether there was a bell, a push-button, or whether I attracted attention by clapping my hands.</span>
<span class="test">The stuttering sparks of the music kept on.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">But from the end of the avenue, from the main house, a lantern approached; a lantern which alternately, from moment to moment, was crisscrossed or put out by the trunks of the trees; a paper lantern shaped like a drum and colored like the moon.</span>
<span class="test">A tall man carried it.</span>
<span class="test">I could not see his face for the light blinded me.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">He opened the gate and spoke slowly in my language.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">"I see that the worthy Hsi P'eng has troubled himself to see to relieving my solitude. No doubt you want to see the garden?"</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">Recognizing the name of one of our consuls, I replied, somewhat taken aback.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">"The garden?"</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">"The garden of forking paths."</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">Something stirred in my memory and I said, with incomprehensible assurance: "The garden of my ancestor, Ts'ui Pen."</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">"Your ancestor? Your illustrious ancestor? Come in."</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">The damp path zigzagged like those of my childhood.</span>
<span class="test">When we reached the house, we went into a library filled with books from both East and West.</span>
<span class="test">I recognized some large volumes bound in yellow silk-manuscripts of the Lost Encyclopedia which was edited by the Third Emperor of the Luminous Dynasty.</span>
<span class="test">They had never been printed.</span>
<span class="test">A phonograph record was spinning near a bronze phoenix.</span>
<span class="test">I remember also a rose-glazed jar and yet another, older by many centuries, of that blue color which our potters copied from the Persians ...</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">Stephen Albert was watching me with a smile on his face.</span>
<span class="test">He was, as I have said, remarkably tall.</span>
<span class="test">His face was deeply lined and he had gray eyes and a gray beard.</span>
<span class="test">There was about him something of the priest, and something of the sailor.</span>
<span class="test">Later, he told me he had been a missionary in Tientsin before he "had aspired to become a Sinologist.”</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">We sat down, I upon a large, low divan, he with his back to the window and to a large circular clock.</span>
<span class="test">I calculated that my pursuer, Richard Madden, could not arrive in less than an hour.</span>
<span class="test">My irrevocable decision could wait.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">"A strange destiny," said Stephen Albert, "that of Ts'ui Pen - Governor of his native province, learned in astronomy, in astrology and tireless in the interpretation of the canonical books, a chess player , a famous poet and a calligrapher.</span>
<span class="test">Yet he abandoned all to make a book and a labyrinth.</span>
<span class="test">He gave up all the pleasures of oppression, justice, of a well-stocked bed, of banquets, and even of erudition, and shut himself up in the Pavilion of the Limpid Sun for thirteen years.</span>
<span class="test">At his death, his heirs found only a mess of manuscripts.</span>
<span class="test">The family, as you doubtless know, wished to consign them to the fire, but the executor of the estate - a Taoist or a Buddhist monk - insisted on their publication."</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">"Those of the blood of Ts'ui Pen," I replied, "still curse the memory of that monk.</span>
<span class="test">Such a publication was madness.</span>
<span class="test">The book is a shapeless mass of contradictory rough drafts.</span>
<span class="test">I examined it once upon a time: the hero dies in the third chapter, while in the fourth he is alive.</span>
<span class="test">As for that other enterprise of Ts'ui Pen ... his Labyrinth ..."</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">"Here is the Labyrinth," Albert said, pointing to a tall, lacquered writing cabinet.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">"An ivory labyrinth?" I exclaimed.</span>
<span class="test">"A tiny labyrinth indeed ... !"</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">"A symbolic labyrinth," he corrected me.</span>
<span class="test">"An invisible labyrinth of time.</span>
<span class="test">I, a barbarous Englishman, have been given the key to this transparent mystery.</span>
<span class="test">After more than a hundred years most of the details are irrecoverable, lost beyond all recall, but it isn't hard to image what must have happened.</span>
<span class="test">At one time, Ts'ui Pen must have said; 'I am going into seclusion to write a book,' and at another, 'I am retiring to construct a maze.'</span>
<span class="test">Everyone assumed these were separate activities.</span>
<span class="test">No one realized that the book and the labyrinth were one and the same.</span>
<span class="test">The Pavilion of the Limpid Sun was set in the middle of an intricate garden.</span>
<span class="test">This may have suggested the idea of a physical maze.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">"Ts'ui Pen died. In all the vast lands which once belonged to your family, no one could find the labyrinth.</span>
<span class="test">The novel's confusion suggested that it was the labyrinth.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">Two circumstances showed me the direct solution to the problem.</span>
<span class="test">First, the curious legend that Ts'ui Pen had proposed to create an infinite maze, second, a fragment of a letter which I discovered."</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">Albert rose.</span>
<span class="test">For a few moments he turned his back to me.</span>
<span class="test">He opened the top drawer in the high black and gilded writing cabinet.</span>
<span class="test">He returned holding in his hand a piece of paper which had once been crimson but which had faded with the passage of time: it was rose colored, tenuous, quadrangular.</span>
<span class="test">Ts'ui Pen's calligraphy was justly famous.</span>
<span class="test">Eagerly, but without understanding, I read the words which a man of my own blood had written with a small brush: "I leave to various future times, but not to all, my garden of forking paths."</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">I handed back the sheet of paper in silence.</span>
<span class="test">Albert went on: "Before I discovered this letter, I kept asking myself how a book could be infinite.</span>
<span class="test">I could not imagine any other than a cyclic volume, circular.</span>
<span class="test">A volume whose last page would be the same as the first and so have the possibility of continuing indefinitely.</span>
<span class="test">I recalled, too, the night in the middle of The Thousand and One Nights when Queen Scheherezade, through a magical mistake on the part of her copyist, started to tell the story of The Thousand and One Nights, with the risk of again arriving at the night upon which she will relate it, and thus on to infinity.</span>
<span class="test">I also imagined a Platonic hereditary work, passed on from father to son, to which each individual would add a new chapter or correct, with pious care, the work of his elders.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">"These conjectures gave me amusement, but none seemed to have the remotest application to the contradictory chapters of Ts'ui Pen.</span>
<span class="test">At this point, I was sent from Oxford the manuscript you have just seen.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">"Naturally, my attention was caught by the sentence, 'I leave to various future times, but not to all, my garden of forking paths: I had no sooner read this, than I understood.</span>
<span class="test">The Garden of Forking Paths was the chaotic novel itself.</span>
<span class="test">The phrase 'to various future times, but not to all' suggested the image of bifurcating in time, not in space.</span>
<span class="test">Rereading the whole work confirmed this theory.</span>
<span class="test">In all fiction, when a man is faced with alternatives he chooses one at the expense of the others.</span>
<span class="test">In the almost unfathomable Ts'ui Pen, he chooses - simultaneously - all of them.</span>
<span class="test">He thus creates various futures, various times which start others that will in their turn branch out and bifurcate in other times.</span>
<span class="test">This is the cause of the contradictions in the novel.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">"Fang, let us say, has a secret.</span>
<span class="test">A stranger knocks at his door.</span>
<span class="test">Fang makes up his mind to kill him.</span>
<span class="test">Naturally there are various possible outcomes.</span>
<span class="test">Fang can kill the intruder, the intruder can kill Fang, both can be saved, both can die and so on and so on.</span>
<span class="test">In Ts'ui Pen's work, all the possible solutions occur, each one being the point of departure for other bifurcations.</span>
<span class="test">Sometimes the pathways of this labyrinth converge.</span>
<span class="test">For example, you come to this house; but in other possible pasts you are my enemy; in others my friend.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">"If you will put up with my atrocious pronunciation, I would like to read you a few pages of your ancestor's work."</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">His countenance, in the bright circle of lamplight, was certainly that of an ancient, but it shone with something unyielding, even immortal.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">With slow precision, he read two versions of the same epic chapter.</span>
<span class="test">In the first, an army marches into battle over a desolate mountain pass.</span>
<span class="test">The bleak and somber aspect of the rocky landscape made the soldiers feel that life itself was of little value, and so they won the battle easily.</span>
<span class="test">In the second, the same army passes through a palace where a banquet is in progress.</span>
<span class="test">The splendor of the feast remained a memory throughout the glorious battle, and so victory followed.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">With proper veneration I listened to these old tales, although perhaps with less admiration for them in themselves than for the fact that they had been thought out by one of my own blood, and that a man of a distant empire had given them back to me, in the last stage of a desperate adventure, on a Western island.</span>
<span class="test">I remember the final words, repeated at the end of each version like a secret command: "Thus the heroes fought, with tranquil heart and bloody sword.</span>
<span class="test">They were resigned to killing and to dying."</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">At that moment I felt within me and around me something invisible and intangible pullulating.</span>
<span class="test">It was not the pullulation of two divergent, parallel, and finally converging armies, but an agitation more inaccessible, more intimate, prefigured by them in some way.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">Stephen Albert continued: "I do not think that your illustrious ancestor toyed idly with variations.</span>
<span class="test">I do not find it believable that he would waste thirteen years laboring over a never ending experiment in rhetoric.</span>
<span class="test">In your country the novel is an inferior genre; in Ts'ui Pen's period, it was a despised one.</span>
<span class="test">Ts'ui Pen was a fine novelist but he was also a man of letters who, doubtless, considered himself more than a mere novelist.</span>
<span class="test">The testimony of his contemporaries attests to this, and certainly the known facts of his life confirm his leanings toward the metaphysical and the mystical.</span>
<span class="test">Philosophical conjectures take up the greater part of his novel.</span>
<span class="test">I know that of all problems, none disquieted him more, and none concerned him more than the profound one of time.</span>
<span class="test">Now then, this is the only problem that does not figure in the pages of The Garden.</span>
<span class="test">He does not even use the word which means time. How can these voluntary omissions be explained?"</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">I proposed various solutions, all of them inadequate.</span>
<span class="test">We discussed them.</span>
<span class="test">Finally Stephen Albert said: "In a guessing game to which the answer is chess, which word is the only one prohibited?"</span>
<span class="test">I thought for a moment and then replied: "The word is chess."</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">"Precisely," said Albert.</span>
<span class="test">"The Garden of Forking Paths is an enormous guessing game, or parable, in which the subject is time.</span>
<span class="test">The rules of the game forbid the use of the word itself.</span>
<span class="test">To eliminate a word completely, to refer to it by means of inept phrases and obvious paraphrases, is perhaps the best way of drawing attention to it.</span>
<span class="test">This, then, is the tortuous method of approach preferred by the oblique Ts'ui Pen in every meandering of his interminable novel.</span>
<span class="test">I have gone over hundreds of manuscripts, I have corrected errors introduced by careless copyists, I have worked out the plan from this chaos, I have restored, or believe I have restored, the original.</span>
<span class="test">I have translated the whole work.</span>
<span class="test">I can state categorically that not once has the word time been used in the whole book.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">"The explanation is obvious.</span>
<span class="test">The Garden of Forking Paths is a picture, incomplete yet not false, of the universe such as Ts'ui Pen conceived it to be.</span>
<span class="test">Differing from Newton and Schopenhauer, your ancestor did not think of time as absolute and uniform.</span>
<span class="test">He believed in an infinite series of times, in a dizzily growing, ever spreading network of diverging, converging and parallel times.</span>
<span class="test">This web of time - the strands of which approach one another, bifurcate, intersect or ignore each other through the centuries - embraces every possibility.</span>
<span class="test">We do not exist in most of them.</span>
<span class="test">In some you exist and not I, while in others I do, and you do not, and in yet others both of us exist.</span>
<span class="test">In this one, in which chance has favored me, you have come to my gate.</span>
<span class="test">In another, you, crossing the garden, have found me dead.</span>
<span class="test">In yet another, I say these very same words, but am an error, a phantom."</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">"In all of them," I enunciated, with a tremor in my voice.</span>
<span class="test">"I deeply appreciate and am grateful to you for the restoration of Ts'ui Pen's garden."</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">"Not in all," he murmured with a smile.</span>
<span class="test">"Time is forever dividing itself toward innumerable futures and in one of them I am your enemy."</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">Once again I sensed the pullulation of which I have already spoken.</span>
<span class="test">It seemed to me that the dew-damp garden surrounding the house was infinitely saturated with invisible people.</span>
<span class="test">All were Albert and myself, secretive, busy and multiform in other dimensions of time.</span>
<span class="test">I lifted my eyes and the short nightmare disappeared.</span>
<span class="test">In the black and yellow garden there was only a single man, but this man was as strong as a statue and this man was walking up the path and he was Captain Richard Madden.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">"The future exists now," I replied.</span>
<span class="test">"But I am your friend. Can I take another look at the letter?"</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">Albert rose from his seat.</span>
<span class="test">He stood up tall as he opened the top drawer of the high writing cabinet.</span>
<span class="test">For a moment his back was again turned to me.</span>
<span class="test">I had the revolver ready.</span>
<span class="test">I fired with the utmost care: Albert fell without a murmur, at once.</span>
<span class="test">I swear that his death was instantaneous, as if he had been struck by lightning.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="test" style="margin-left: 45px;">What remains is unreal and unimportant.</span>
<span class="test">Madden broke in and arrested me.</span>
<span class="test">I have been condemned to hang.</span>
<span class="test">Abominably, I have yet triumphed!</span>
<span class="test">The secret name of the city to be attacked got through to Berlin.</span>
<span class="test">Yesterday it was bombed.</span>
<span class="test">I read the news in the same English newspapers which were trying to solve the riddle of the murder of the learned Sinologist Stephen Albert by the unknown Yu Tsun.</span>
<span class="test">The Chief, however, had already solved this mystery.</span>
<span class="test">He knew that my problem was to shout, with my feeble voice, above the tumult of war, the name of the city called Albert, and that I had no other course open to me than to kill someone of that name.</span>
<span class="test">He does not know, for no one can, of my infinite penitence and sickness of the heart.</span>
